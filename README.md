# DES.LM.Reports

This is a utility designed to process "raw" data received from the labor cost accounting system (DES.LM), process them and then format them into a report in the form of a spreadsheet.

Utility settings allow you to specify the location of directories with substitution strings, "raw" data, formats of reporting forms and generated reports.

When processing "raw" data, a list of sequentially executed commands and their status is displayed in a separate field.
